You are a go-to-market strategist using a systematic customer segmentation framework.

Business Name: ${name}
Business Description: ${desc}

CUSTOMER CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK:

Step 1 - Analyze Primary Customer Characteristics:

A. PRIMARY CUSTOMER TYPE:
- B2C: Individual consumers buying for personal use
- B2B-SME: Small/medium businesses (2-500 employees)
- B2B-Enterprise: Large corporations (>$1B revenue, buying committees)
- B2G: Government agencies, ministries, defense, SOEs
- B2B2C: Business customers who serve end consumers through your product
- C2C: Individual peers transacting with each other (marketplace)
- B2N: Non-profits, NGOs, foundations, social enterprises

B. DEAL SIZE INDICATORS:
- Very Low: <$100 typical transaction
- Low: $100-$10K per deal
- Medium: $10K-$100K per deal  
- High: $100K-$1M+ per deal

C. SALES CYCLE LENGTH:
- Minutes-Hours: Immediate purchase decisions
- Days-Weeks: Short consideration period
- Weeks-Months: Medium sales cycle with evaluation
- Months-Years: Long enterprise/government sales cycles

D. RELATIONSHIP DEPTH REQUIRED:
- Transactional: One-off purchases, minimal relationship
- Relational: Ongoing service relationship, account management
- Strategic Partnership: Deep integration, joint planning
- Mission-Aligned: Values-based, impact-focused partnerships

Step 2 - Apply Customer Type Decision Logic:

PRIMARY CLASSIFICATION RULES:
1. If end users are individuals buying for personal use → B2C
2. If customers are small businesses with limited IT/budget → B2B-SME  
3. If customers are large enterprises with buying committees → B2B-Enterprise
4. If customers are government entities with public procurement → B2G
5. If business customers embed your product for their end users → B2B2C
6. If individuals transact with each other through your platform → C2C
7. If customers are mission-driven organizations with grant funding → B2N

VALIDATION CRITERIA:
- B2C: Mobile-first, social proof driven, CAC:LTV ratios, viral growth
- B2B-SME: Self-serve onboarding, product-led growth, seat-based pricing
- B2B-Enterprise: RFP processes, POCs, multi-year contracts, custom integrations
- B2G: Tender processes, compliance requirements, public transparency
- B2B2C: White-label technology, partner enablement, dual support model
- C2C: Two-sided marketplace, trust & safety, network effects, transaction fees
- B2N: Impact measurement, grant cycles, sliding scale pricing

Step 3 - Validate with Revenue & Sales Patterns:

REVENUE LOGIC ALIGNMENT:
- B2C: One-off sales, freemium-to-paid, ads, micro-transactions
- B2B-SME: Per-seat SaaS MRR, usage-based billing, implementation fees
- B2B-Enterprise: Enterprise licenses, professional services 15-30% of ACV
- B2G: Fixed-price contracts, cost-plus, performance-based payments
- B2B2C: Wholesale pricing, revenue sharing, per-API call fees
- C2C: Take-rate 5-30%, listing fees, promoted placement
- B2N: Grant-subsidized, sliding-scale, impact-based bonuses

SALES & DELIVERY PATTERNS:
- B2C: Paid ads, SEO, influencer marketing, self-serve
- B2B-SME: Content marketing, webinars, inside sales, product-led growth
- B2B-Enterprise: Named account sales, consultative selling, RFP responses
- B2G: Bid/no-bid decisions, formal tenders, local partnerships
- B2B2C: Strategic alliance negotiations, technical enablement
- C2C: Growth loops, geographic seeding, dual-sided acquisition
- B2N: Relationship-driven, pilot programs, impact demonstrations

Step 4 - Check for Mixed Models:

HYBRID PATTERNS:
- Prosumer SaaS (B2C + B2B-SME): Individual users who expand to team plans
- GovTech Platform (B2B2G): Technology companies serving government through partners
- Marketplace + Native Supply: Platform with some owned inventory/services
- Mission-Blended (B2N ↔ B2B): Serving both commercial and non-profit sectors

If multiple patterns apply significantly, classify as primary with secondary in "other" array.

ANALYSIS PROCESS:
1. Identify WHO is actually making the purchase decision
2. Analyze deal size and sales cycle patterns from description
3. Determine relationship depth and revenue model
4. Validate against typical sales/delivery patterns
5. Check for hybrid characteristics
6. Classify based on dominant customer pattern

Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "main": "B2B-SME",
  "other": ["B2C"],
  "justification": "Primary customer base consists of [specific customer type] with [deal size] transactions and [sales cycle] cycle. Revenue through [model] and [sales pattern] confirms B2B-SME classification, with some B2C characteristics in [specific area]."
}

Rules:
- "main" must be exactly "B2C", "B2B-SME", "B2B-Enterprise", "B2G", "B2B2C", "C2C", or "B2N"
- "other" must be an array (can be empty [] or contain secondary characteristics)
- "justification" must cite specific framework criteria and evidence from the description
- Focus on WHO makes the buying decision and HOW they buy
- Return ONLY the JSON, no other text`;
